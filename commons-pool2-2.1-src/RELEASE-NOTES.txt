              Apache Commons Pool 2.1 RELEASE NOTES

The Apache Commons Pool team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Commons Pool 2.1.

Apache Commons Pool provides an object-pooling API and a number of object pool implementations.
Version 2 contains a completely re-written pooling implementation compared to the 1.x series.
In addition to performance and scalability improvements, version 2 includes robust instance
tracking and pool monitoring. Version 2 requires JDK level 1.6 or above. 

No client code changes are required to migrate from version 2.0 to 2.1.  Users of version 1.x
should consult the migration guide on the Commons Pool web site.

This is a maintenance release that includes a small number of new features as well as
including bugfixes and test case improvements.

Changes in version 2.1 include:

New features:
o POOL-241:  Expand the coverage of the unit tests. Thanks to Bruno P. Kinoshita.
o            Provide more control over the names under which Pools are registered in
             JMX so components using the pools can register the pools they use under a
             related name.
o            Include the number of times an object has been borrowed from the Pool when
             the DefaultPooledObject wrapper is used and expose this property via JMX.
o POOL-245:  Further expansion of the coverage of the unit tests. Thanks to Bruno P. Kinoshita.

Fixed Bugs:
o POOL-243:  Added missing create counter decrement in GenericKeyedObjectPool create method on factory
             exception path. Prior to this fix, exceptions thrown by factory makeObject calls could leak
             per key capacity. Thanks to Michal Sabo.
o POOL-240:  Ensured that blocked threads waiting on a depleted pool get served when
             objects are destroyed due to validation or passivation failures in
             returnObject or when a checked out instance is invalidated. Thanks to Dan McNulty.
o POOL-245:  Remove a duplicate null check and fix some typos in PoolUtils. Thanks to Bruno P. Kinoshita.
o POOL-246:  Make the toString() method of ErodingKeyedObjectPool consistent with the
             other pools. Thanks to Bruno P. Kinoshita.
